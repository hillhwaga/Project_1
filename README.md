We are CG, a new startup consultant agency. We work with adult individuals from the ages of 16 and older. Our prime focus is in analyzing the social-economic status of each individual and advising on which employment path to take. Our goal as a company is to serve our clients, and our long-term goal is to improve on personalizing the advice on which path to take. Whether it is to go gain more education qualifications or pursue a career.
